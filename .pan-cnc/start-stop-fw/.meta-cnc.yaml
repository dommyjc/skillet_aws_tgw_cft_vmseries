label: AWS Transit Gateway Firewalls Step 2 Route Failover Demo

description: >

  A lambda function monitors the health of the firewalls and will failover connections to the standby firewall.
  Various configuration options are available to modify the behaviour of the failover script.

  1) Splitroutes yes enables Internet traffic via primary firewall (FW1) with East/West by the secondary (FW2)

  3) Preempt YES/NO controls the failback option once the failed device becomes available again

# more complex skillets may express a dependency on another skillet that should be loaded before this one.
# For example, a set of skillets may build off of a single 'golden config' that contains shared configuration
# As this skillet is very simple, there is no need to build on another one.
